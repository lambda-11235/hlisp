# HLisp

This is an attempt to make a lisp who's base is very minimal. This is for
theoretical purposes only. See doc/formal/formal.pdf for a specification of
HLisp. See lib/ for example code.

##

To run HLisp enter the following at the command line.
```
> cabal run
```

To use the base library run
```
> cabal run lib/*
```

I would suggest using [rlwrap](http://utopia.knoware.nl/~hlub/uck/rlwrap/) when
using the interpreter.
